# Graphiti

This directory contains the implementation of the Graphiti framework for secure graph computation. The protocol is implemented in C++17 and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) is used as the build system.

## External Dependencies
The following libraries need to be installed separately and should be available to the build system and compiler.

- [GMP](https://gmplib.org/)
- [NTL](https://www.shoup.net/ntl/) (11.0.0 or later)
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) (1.72.0 or later)
- [Nlohmann JSON](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
- [EMP Tool](https://github.com/emp-toolkit/emp-tool)


## Compilation
The project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for building the source code. 
To compile, run the following commands from the root directory of the repository:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

make benchmarks
```
